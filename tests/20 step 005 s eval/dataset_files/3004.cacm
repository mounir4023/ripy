Structured Programming in Cobol: An Approach for Application Programmers
Techniques for designing and writing Cobol programs
are presented.  Previous work in structured 
programming is drawn upon and adapted.  The presentation
is informal: the terminology is nonmathematical 
as far as possible, no theorems are proved, and examples
are used frequently.  Top-down program design 
is implemented through the use of structured flowcharts,
disciplined specifications, and step by step 
verification.  A well-formed Cobol program is defined.
 The proper use of the GO TO and other Cobol coding 
practices are discussed.
