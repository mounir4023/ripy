BLISS: A Language for Systems Programming
A language, BLISS, is described.  This language
is designed so as to be especially suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.  Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.  A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.
