A Practical Approach to Managing Resources and Avoiding Deadlocks
Resource scheduling and allocation can be expensive
with regard to time and space in multiprogramming 
or time-sharing environments involving large numbers of
tasks and resources with conflicting requirements. 
 Detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can require
massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient 
usage of resources is to be maintained.  A resource
management program is described which uses linked 
lists along with other techniques to overcome a large
portion of this overhead.  The program, which is 
currently running as part of a large scale general purpose
operating system, keeps resources relatively 
active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks
in its implemented state.  Certain changes, which 
would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlock
prevention/detection at additional cost, have not 
been incorporated in the running system due
to the infrequency of deadlock situations.
