The Programmer's Workbench-A Machine for Software Development
On almost all software development projects the
assumption is made that the program development 
function will be done on the same machine on which the
eventual system will run.  It is only when this 
production machine is unavailable or when its programming
environment is totally inadequate that alternatives 
are considered.  In this paper it is suggested that
there are many other situations where it would be 
advantageous to separate the program development and
main tenance function onto a specialized computer 
which is dedicated to that purpose.  Such a computer
is here called a Programmer's Workbench.  The four 
basic sections of the paper in troduce the subject,outline
the general concept, discuss areas where such 
an approach may prove beneficial, and describe
an operational system utilizing this concept.
