A programming language is described which
is applicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  By this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  The advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.
