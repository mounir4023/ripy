   An Algebraic Compiler for the FORTRAN Assembly Program
   An algebraic compiler has been written which may be added to the FORTRAN 
Assembly Program. This compiler will expand all algebraic statements with the 
following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It
will compile multi-level expressions in floating-point arithmetic (this is
easily be revised to fixed-point).
