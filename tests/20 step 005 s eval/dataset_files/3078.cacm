Analysis of the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra
Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  These results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  A major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to Markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  Since many physical
systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.
