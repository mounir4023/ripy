Architecture of the IBM System/370
This paper discusses the design considerations
for the architectural extensions that distinguish 
System/370 from System/360.  It comments on some experiences
with the original objectives for System/360 
and on the efforts to achieve them, and it describes the
reasons and objectives for extending the architecture. 
It covers virtual storage, program control, data-manipulation
instructions, timing facilities, multiprocessing, 
debugging and monitoring, error handling, and input/output
operations.  A final section tabulates some 
of the important parameters of the various IBM
machines which implement the architecture.
