Effects of Chargeout on User/Manager Attitudes
The relationship of in ternal pricing systems
for computer services (chargeout systems) and 
user management attitudes about their computer-based
information systems is investigated. Evidence is 
provided that the relationship conforms to a general
pattern that would be expected from the hypothesis 
of the four stages of EDP growth [15].  The results also
indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic 
of advanced EDP stage environments are associated with
relatively high levels of positive user attitudes 
and marked increases in EDP training for users. Both factors
are important to the user/manager involvement 
necessary for effective control of computer-based systems.
 Development and main tenance of computer-based 
systems is asserted to be a category of organizational
change.  A "felt need" for the change on the part 
of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change taking
place.  The research methods of behavioral science 
are applied to investigate the user/manager
environment and the effects of chargeout.
