Dribble Posting a Master File
Many business applications employ sequential
magnetic tape rather than random-access storage 
techniques to process a very small number of transactions
against a voluminous master file.  In such 
situations, it may prove economical to avoid creating a
new master file during each updating run by producing 
instead a dribble ledger containing only those master
file accounts which have experienced activity.
