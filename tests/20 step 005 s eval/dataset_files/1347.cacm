General Time-Varying Systems Error Sensitivities Program
The evaluation, by the propagation of variance
technique, of the sensitivity of time-varying 
systems to initial condition and parameter errors, involves
the determination of several system-dependent 
partial derivative matrices.  This requirement has led to
separate programs for each system under investigation. 
 A new program, through utilization of the Wengert differentiation
technique, automatically determines 
the required matrices from specific system equations supplied
in subroutine form at execution time, eliminating 
the need for individualized programs, and presaging the
further development of extremely general computer 
programs.
