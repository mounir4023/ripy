A Methodology for Interactive Computer Service Measurement
A measurement methodology applicable to in teractive
computer service is described.  Its primary 
purpose is to enable external, user-oriented assessment
of computer performance, instead of the more 
frequently used in ternal system measurement techniques.
 The NBS Network Measurement System is employed 
as the external measurement tool.  Example data have
been collected and analyzed.  A demonstration of 
the methodology, leading to a pragmatic figure-of-merit
evaluation of results, is included.
