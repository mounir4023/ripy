   Symbolic Manipulation of Poisson Series
   Poisson series of three variables are manageable symbolically through as a 
set of formal subroutines written partially in the IBM 7094 machine language,
but to be called in the FORTRAN language for use in Fortran  programs. An 
effort has been made to supply those operations which are most required by
celestial mechanics. The routines are entirely self-contained subroutines
and require only standard Fortran input/output units 5 and 6; they are design
to avoid waste and overflow of core storage space.
