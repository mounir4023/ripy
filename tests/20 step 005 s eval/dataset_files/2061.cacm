An Algorithm for the Construction Of Bounded-Context Parsers
An algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary context-free
grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser for
it whenever such a parser exists.  In the first part of the paper
the definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a
bounded-context parser are recalled.  The notion of reduction class for
a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with
the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated.  Next,
pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes
of a context-free grammar are defined.  Finally, the algorithm is described;
it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible
runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes.
In the second part, the utility of the algorithm is discuss
ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.
The algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the
simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it.
