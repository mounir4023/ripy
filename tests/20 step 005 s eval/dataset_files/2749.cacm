Significant Event Simulation
This paper compares a new method of simulation
organization, called the significant event method, 
with an old one, called the clock pulse method, using
as examples two automobile traffic models.  The 
significant event method is found to be more efficient
than the clock pulse method at low levels of system 
interaction and less efficient at high levels.  A simple
mathematical model for the trade-off in the 
relative running time of the two methods is developed. 
The model aids in choosing between the two simulation 
methods for a particular experiment.  It is concluded
that the significant event method can be of value 
in the simulation of some systems when computational
efficiency is of sufficient importance.
