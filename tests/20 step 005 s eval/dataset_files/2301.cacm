Generating Parsers for Affix Grammars
Affix grammars are two-level grammars which
are similar to van Wijngaarden's two-level grammars 
used in the definition of Algol 68.  Affix grammars are shown
by Koster to be equal in power to van Wijngaarden 
grammars.  They are much more suited to parsing than
are the latter, however.  Koster, the inventor of 
affix based on recursive procedures.  This paper presents
a bottom-up scheme for parsing them, based 
on an extension of Floyd Production Language (FPL).  Included
is an algorithm, similar to that of DeRemer's, 
for converting a large class of affix grammars into FPL.
 The paper concludes by discussing briefly the 
applicabilities of the conversion algorithm and affix
grammars in general, and some possible extensions 
to Koster's definition of affix grammars.
