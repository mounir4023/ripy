A Contour-Map Program for X-Ray Crystallography
A FORTRAN program is described for use with
the IBM 7090 system and an X, Y-plotter to produce 
a contour map.  A matrix of points evenly spaced in
each dimension is contoured.  Scale factors along 
the axes may be different and the axes need not be perpendicular.
