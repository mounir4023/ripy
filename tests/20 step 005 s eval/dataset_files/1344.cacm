Statistical Computations Based Upon Algebraically Specified Models
Based upon a machine-readable statistical model
and related symbolic specifications, an efficient 
method of performing calculations for statistical models
of a balanced complete nature is presented. 
 Fixes, mixed, and random analysis of variance models
are considered.  A procedure for obtaining variance 
components and calculated F statistics for the model terms is included.
