Conversion of Decision Tables To Computer Programs
Several translation procedures for the conversion
of decision tables to programs are presented 
and then evaluated in terms of storage requirements,
execution time and compile time.  The procedures 
are valuable as hand-coding guides or as algorithms for
a compiler.  Both limited-entry and extended-entry 
tables are analyzed.  In addition to table analysis,
the nature of table-oriented programming languages 
and features is discussed.  It is presumed that the reader
is familiar with the nature of decision tables 
and conventional definitions.
