Numerical Integration of a Differential-Difference
Equation with a Decreasing Time-Lag
Systems in which variable time-lags are present
are of common occurrence in biology.  Variable 
flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags.
 At present no extensive body of knowledge exists 
concerning the effects which these variable lags can
cause.  Shown here is a method of reducing some 
differential-difference equations to ordinary differential
equations which can then be studied numerically 
with ease.  Subsequent study will deal with situations
in which multiple-lags and lags dependent on the 
solution itself are present.
