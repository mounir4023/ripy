Significance Arithmetic on a Digital Computer
The 7090 at NYU has been modified to include
a "Significance Mode" of operation which is intended 
to facilitate the identification of significant bits in
the results of floating-point arithmetic operations. 
 The manner in which floating-point arithmetic is handled
in this mode is discussed.  Several numerical 
experiments using this mode are described and comparisons
are made with the ordinary "normalized mode." 
 Examples include power series evaluation, linear equations
solution, determinant evaluation and matrix 
inversion.
