Overview of the EFT Symposium
It is increasingly recognized that large-scale technologies such as EFT
have the potential for aiding in the solution of current societal problems.
Yet, these technologies also generate problems.  This symposium
presents selected papers from a conference that sought to discover
what is currently known about EFT impacts in society
and what research is needed in the future.
