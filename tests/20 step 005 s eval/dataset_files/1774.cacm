Program Overlay Techniques
The general features of program overlay systems
are described.  Three main types -- automatic, 
semiautomatic and nonautomatic -- are classified, and the
programming techniques are explained as a function 
of machine hardware and other system features.  The
implementation of semiautomatic overlay facility 
in a multiprogrammed system on the CDC 6600 is described
in detail, with special reference to real time 
applications.
