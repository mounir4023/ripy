Abstract Data Types and the Development of Data Structures
Abstract data types can play a significant role
in the development of software that is reliable, 
efficient, and flexible.  This paper presents and discusses
the application of an algebraic technique 
for the specification of abstract data types.  Among
the examples presented is a top-down development 
of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion
of the proof of its correctness is given. 
 The paper also contains a brief discussion of the problems
involved in constructing algebraic specifications 
that are both consistent and complete.
