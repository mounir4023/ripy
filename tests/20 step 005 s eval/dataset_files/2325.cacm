Numerical Mathematics and Computer Science
Numerical mathematics is viewed as the analysis
of continuous algorithms.  Four of the components 
of numerical mathematics are discussed.  These are: foundations
(finite precision number systems, computational 
complexity), synthesis and analysis of algorithms,
analysis of error, programs and program libraries.
