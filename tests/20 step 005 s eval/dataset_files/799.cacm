Design of a Separable Transition-Diagram Compiler*
A COBOL compiler design is presented which is
compact enough to permit rapid, one-pass compilation 
of a large subset of COBOL on a moderately large computer.
 Versions of the same compiler for smaller 
machines require only two working tapes plus a compiler
tape.  The methods given are largely applicable 
to the construction of ALGOL compilers.
