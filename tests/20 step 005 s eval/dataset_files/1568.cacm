Plotting a Function of Three Independent Variables
A method is developed for constructing an approximate
plot of a function of three independent 
variables.  The plot is similar to a conventional contour
map except that there are three scales to represent 
the independent variables.  Scale values of the three
independent variables are added vectorially, and 
the value of the function is then read from
the values associated with nearby contours.
