A Recurrence Scheme for Converting from
One Orthogonal Expansion into Another
A generalization of a scheme of Hamming for
converting a polynomial Pn(x) into a Chebyshev 
series is combined with a recurrence scheme of Clenshaw
for summing any finite series whose terms satisfy 
a three-term recurrence formula.
