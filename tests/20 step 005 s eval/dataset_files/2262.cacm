Garbage Collection for Virtual Memory Computer Systems
In list processing there is typically a growing
demand for space during program execution. 
 This paper examines the practical implications of this
growth within a virtual memory computer system, 
proposes two new garbage collection techniques for virtual
memory systems, and compares them with traditional 
methods by discussion and by simulation.
