A Buddy System Variation for Disk Storage Allocation
A generalization of the buddy system for storage
allocation is described. The set of permitted 
block sizes {SIZE(i)}, i=0,n, must satisfy the condition
SIZE(i)=SIZE(i-1)+SIZE(i-k(i)) where k may be 
any meaningful integral-valued function.  This makes it
possible to force logical storage blocks to coincide 
with physical storage blocks, such as tracks and cylinders.
