The LRLTRAN Compiler
Extensive software problems confront an organization
which possesses a number of different 
computers and which frequently acquires new ones. 
To maintain cohesion, a system must be developed, 
written in a high level language, which minimizes machine
dependencies and isolates those which are necessary. 
 A language and a compiler for the language are discussed
here.  The language, called LRLTRAN, is a heavily 
augmented FORTRAN.  The tree-pass compiler makes use
internally of a postfix Polish notation (pass I 
to pass II) and a tree representation referred to as
a "composite blocking table" (pass I to pass III). 
 Machine-independent optimization occurs in pass II
and DO-loop and machine-dependent optimization in 
pass III.
