The Implementation of a BASIC System in a Multiprogramming Environment
The implementation of a remote terminal BASIC system
within the context of an existing multiprogramming 
computer system, the Burroughs B5500, is described.
 This implementation combines a unique mixture of 
machine language and interpretive techniques with an incremental compiler.
