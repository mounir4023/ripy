 I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment.  I wouldrather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations,as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem.  Remote procedurecalls and message-passing are examples of my interests.
