 articles about the sensitivity of the eigenvalue decomposition of realmatrices, in particular, zero-one matrices.  i'm especially interested inthe separation of eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.articles on the subject:c. davis and w.m. kahn, "the rotation of eigenvectors by a permutation:,siam j. numerical analysis, vol. 7, no. 1 (1970); g.w. stewart, "errorbounds for approximate invariant subspaces of closed linear operators",siam j. numerical analysis., vol. 8, no. 4 (1971)..adavis, c.kahn, w.m.stewart, g.w.
