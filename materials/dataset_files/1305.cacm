The Internal Structure of the FORTRAN CEP Translator
The FORTRAN CEP translator converts a source
program written in the FORTRAN CEP language into 
an object program written in the language of the CEP
computer.  In this paper, after an outline of the 
CEP computer, the internal structure of the translator
is described.  Emphasis is on the compilation 
of expressions, of input/output lists, and of subscripted variables.
