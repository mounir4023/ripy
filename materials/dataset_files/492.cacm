Analysis of a File Addressing Method
This paper presents a new file addressing method
based on the calculation of an address from 
the identification of a record.  For large recirculating
type files, it seems to be more advantageous 
than customary ones.  The probability distribution of
the displacement of records from their calculated 
address, which is one less than the number of probes
required to address a record, is computed on the 
basis of a Markov chain model.  For the reader not interested
in the mathematics, the introduction and 
the summary should be sufficient.
