A Multiuser Computation Facility for Education and Research
Present-day computing facilities are limited
in their value for scientific research by inability 
to interact strongly with users.  The full power of a
research computing instrument should be available 
at many terminals that give each user the ability to generate,
correct and operate any procedure he wishes, 
either simple or complex.  Implementation is described
for a small-scale multiuser computer system that 
permits several users to work independently with the
machine, and to obtain satisfactory response using 
typewriter communication.
