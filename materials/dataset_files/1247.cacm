An Operating Environment for Dynamic-Recursive
Computer Programming Systems
Presented in this paper is a brief nontechnical
introduction to OEDIPUS, a computer programming 
system which can serve as an operating environment for
dynamic and/or recursive programs and programming 
systems.  The available services include dynamic allocation
of storage for contiguous blocks of arbitrary 
size, input and output for a hierarchy of data types,
a public pushdown list for automatic recursive 
programming, a rudimentary compiler for subroutine
communication and bookkeeping, and debugging aids.
