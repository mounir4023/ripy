FOCUS Microcomputer Number System
FOCUS is a number system and supporting computational
algorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and other
signal processing applications.  FOCUS has the wide-ranging
character of floating-point numbers with a uniformity of state distributions
that give FOCUS better than a twofold accuracy advantage
over an equal word length floating-point system.  FOCUS computations
are typically five times faster than single precision fixed-point
or integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations, comparable in
speed with hardware arithmetic for many applications.  Algorithms
for 8-bit and 16-bit implementations of FOCUS are included.
