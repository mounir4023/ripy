A High Security Log-in Procedure
The protection of time sharing systems from
unauthorized users is often achieved by the use 
of passwords.  By using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,
the risks involved with storing the passwords 
in the computer can be avoided.  We discuss the selection
of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that 
for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are
superior to one-way ciphers derived from Sannon 
codes.
