Storage and Search Properties of a Tree-Organized Memory System
A memory with list properties [1] may be used
to construct numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric 
trees.  Such trees have information storage and retrieval
properties applicable to problems involving 
large quantities of data or to problems where the quantity,
word length and distribution of stored information 
is not known a priori, or changes rapidly during the processing.
 The purpose of this paper is to examine 
the storage and search properties of a tree-organized
storage system assuming that a memory possessing 
certain list properties is available.  Of prime interest
is the application where a symbol table, dictionary 
or similar file is to be stored and searched.
