A View of computer Architecture
An attempt is made to predict the developments
of the next 25 years in the field of computer 
architecture.  Standardized, inexpensive microcomputers
on a single chip are predicted.  These will be 
used extensively to provide logical functions for noncomputational
devices and incidentally for the design 
of superscale computers.
