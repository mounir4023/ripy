Synchronization in a Parallel-Accessed Data Base
The following problem is considered:  Given
a data base which can be manipulated simultaneously 
by more than one process, what are the rules for synchronization
which will maximize the amount of parallel 
activity allowed.  It is assumed that the data base
can be represented as a graph.  An example of such 
a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-line
file system.  Methods for synchronization of 
processes are examined; their validity is
discussed and their performance compared.
