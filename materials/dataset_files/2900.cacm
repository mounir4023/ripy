Some Theorems to Aid in Solving the File Allocation Problem
The file allocation problem-i.e. the problem
of finding the optimal set of network sites at 
which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general,
polynomial complete.  Heuristics and other 
aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions are
therefore much needed.  In this paper we present 
three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate
that certain sites should (or should not) be 
included in an optimal allocation.
