State-Space, Problem-Reduction, and Theorem Proving-Some Relationships
This paper suggests a bidirectional relationship
between state-space and problem-reduction 
representations. It presents a formalism based on multiple-input
and multiple-output operators which 
provides a basis for viewing the two types of representations
in this manner.  A representation of the 
language recognition problem which is based on the Cocke
parsing algorithm is used as an illustration. 
 A method for representing problems in first-order logic
in such a way that the inference system employed 
by a resolution-based theorem prover determines whether
the set of clauses is interpreted in the state-spacer 
mode or in the problem-reduction mode is presented.
 The analogous concepts in problem-reduction and 
theorem proving, and the terminology used to refer to them,
are noted.  The relationship between problem-reduction, 
input resolution, and linear resolution is discussed.
