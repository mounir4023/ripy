The Working Set Model for Program Behavior
Probably the most basic reason behind the absence
of a general treatment of resource allocation 
in modern computer systems is an adequate model for
program behavior.  In this paper a new model, the 
"working set model," is developed. The working set
of pages associated with a process, defined to be 
the collection of its most recently used pages, provides
knowledge vital to the dynamic management of 
paged memories.  "Process" and "working set" are shown to
be manifestations of the same ongoing computational 
activity; then "processor demand" and "memory demand"
are defined; and resource allocation is formulated 
as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.
