An Inexpensive Braille Terminal Device
The active use of time-shared facilities for
blind programmers requires a braille terminal 
system.  Details are given for the construction of a
brailler from a model 33 teletype by modifying the 
print head and increasing the resiliency of the platen.
 A description of the programming needed to drive 
the brailler is presented.
