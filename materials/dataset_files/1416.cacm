A Fortran Technique for Simplifying Input to Report Generators
Typical report generators allow the production
of standard forms when tabulating a magnetic 
tape file; the extraction of nonstandard sets of information,
with suitable annotation, involves troublesome 
forms design.  A method of information extraction involving
the calculation of suitable FORTRAN FORMAT 
statements, which combats this problem, is described.
