Solution of Systems of Polynomial Equations By Elimination
The elimination procedure as described by Williams
has been coded in LISP and FORMAC and used 
in solving systems of polynomial equations.  It is found
that the method is very effective in the case 
of small systems, where it yields all solutions without
the need for initial estimates. The method, by 
itself, appears in appropriate, however, in the solution
of large systems of equation due to the explosive 
growth in the intermediate equations and the hazards
which arise when the coefficients are truncated. 
 A comparison is made with difficulties found in other
problems in non-numerical mathematics such as 
symbolic integration and simplification.
