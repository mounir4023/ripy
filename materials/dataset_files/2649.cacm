On the Distributions of Significant Digits and Roundoff Errors
Generalized logarithmic law is derived for
the distribution of the first t significant digits 
of a random digital integer.  This result is then used
to determine the distribution of the roundoff 
errors in floating-point operations, which is a mixture
of uniform and reciprocal distributions.
