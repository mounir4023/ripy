A Processor Allocation Method for Time-Sharing
A scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of 
tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head.  The algorithm also has
application to more general resource allocation problems.  It is implemented 
by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented 
lists.
