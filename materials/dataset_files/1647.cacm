WATFOR-The University of Waterloo FORTRAN IV Compiler
WATFOR is an in-core, load-and-go compiler
which has been implemented within the IBM 7040/44 
operating system.  FORTRAN IV was selected as the source
language in order to achieve maximum language 
compatibility with other available compiling systems,
in particular the IBM 7040/44 FORTRAN IV system. 
 The principal advantage of the WATFOR compiler is that
it translates FORTRAN IV programs at speeds of 
up to 100 statements per second.  Since the compiler
resides core there is virtually no system overhead, 
and hence large batches of "student" programs may be processed very
efficiently.  The compiler also provides 
extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilation
and the execution phases of a program run.  
This feature makes the system attractive to
both learners and learned users alike.
