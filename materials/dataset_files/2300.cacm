Political Redistricting by Computer
The problems of political redistricting are
considered and a computer method for redistricting 
is presented.  Criteria for acceptable redistricting are
discussed, including population equality, compactness, 
contiguity, and preservation of natural and/or political
boundaries.  Only nonpartisan criteria are considered. 
 Using 1970 Bureau of Census population data, specific
results are given for the ten Congressional Districts 
in the state of Missouri and for the seven St. Louis
County Council seats.  Results from the use of the 
algorithm indicate the feasibility of political
redistricting with the aid of a computer.
