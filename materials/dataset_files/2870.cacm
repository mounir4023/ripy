A Lattice Model of Secure Information Flow
This paper investigates mechanisms that guarantee
secure information flow in a computer system. 
These mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework
suitable for formulating the requirements 
of secure information flow among security classes. The
central component of the model is a lattice structure 
derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics
of information flow.  The lattice properties 
permit concise formulations of the security requirements
of different existing systems and facilitate 
the construction of mechanisms that enforce security.
 The model provides a unifying view of all systems 
that restrict information flow, enables a classification
of them according to security objectives, and 
suggests some new approaches.  It also leads to the construction
of automatic program certification mechanisms 
for verifying the secure flow of information through a program.
