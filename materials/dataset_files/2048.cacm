Comparison of Several Adaptive Newton-Cotes Quadrature Routines
in Evaluating Definite Integrals with Peaked Integrands
This report compares the performance of five different adaptive quadrature 
schemes, based on Newton-Cotes (2N + 1) point rules (N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), in
approximating the set of definite integrals INTEGRAL$1/(x^2 + p^2)) dx with 
relative accuracy e.
