A Note on Compiling Fixed Point Binary Multiplications
An algorithm is developed for compiling, as
a sequence of shifts, additions,and subtractions, 
many fixed point binary multiplications involving a
constant.  The most significant characteristics of 
the algorithm are the simplicity of the test which
determines if the algorithm should be applied and 
the degree to which it "suggests" efficient object code.
