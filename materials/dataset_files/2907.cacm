The Optimal Approach to Recursive Programs
The classical fixed poin t approach toward recursive
programs suggests choosing the "least defined 
fixed poin t" as the most appropriate solution to a recursive
program.  A new approach is described which 
in troduction an " optimal fixed point," which, in contrast
to the least defined fixed poin t, embodies the 
maximal amount of valuable information embedded in the
program.  The practical implications of this approach 
are discussed and techniques for proving properties
of optimal fixed poin t are given.  The presentation 
is informal, with emphasis on examples.
