A Final Solution to the Dangling Else of ALGOL 60 and Related Languages
The dangling else problem consists of a class
of potential ambiguities in ALGOL-like conditional 
statements whose basic form is "if B1 then if B2 then
S1 else S2" where B1 and B2 are Boolean expressions 
and S1 and S2 are basic statements.  The difficulty
lies in whether to attach the else to the first if 
or to the second one.  Existing solutions to the problem
are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. 
 Let Sand S1 be statements.  We define S to be closed
if "S else S1" is not a statement, and to be open 
if "S else S1" is a statement.  Thus an unconditional
statement is  a closed statement.  Open and closed 
conditional statements are defined by syntax equations
in such a way as to preserve openness and closure. 
 In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed
statement.  It is shown that the syntax equations 
are unambiguous, and that may change in the statement
types required within the syntax equations would 
lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction.
