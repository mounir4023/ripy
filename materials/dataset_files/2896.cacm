An Exercise in Proving Parallel Programs Correct
A parallel program, Dijkstra's on-the-fly garbage
collector, is proved correct using a proof 
method developed by Owicki.  The fine degree of in terleaving
in this program makes it especially difficult 
to understand, and complicates the proof greatly.  Difficulties
with proving such parallel programs correct 
are discussed.
