Computation of Algebraic Properties of Elementary
Particle Reactions Using a Digital Computer
A large number of calculations in high-energy
elementary particle physics involve the manipulation 
of complicated algebraic expressions containing both
tensor and noncommutative matrix quantities.  Many 
of these calculations take several months to complete, although
the operations involved follow straightforward 
rules.  In this paper a program is described, which has
been developed in LISP for solving such problems. 
 The manner in which these problems are encountered is
outlined, and their representation in the computer 
discussed.  At present, about six months of human work
takes less than fifteen minutes on an IBM 7090. 
 Limitations of the present system and future plans are also outlined.
