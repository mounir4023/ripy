Rounding Problems in Commercial Data Processing
A common requirement in commercial data processing
is that the sum of a set of numbers, rounded 
in a generally understood manner, be equal to the sum
of the numbers rounded individually.  Four rounding 
procedures are described to accomplish this.  The particular
procedure that is appropriate depends upon 
whether the numbers being accumulated can vary in sign,
whether their sum can vary in sign, and whether 
the last number being summed can be recognized as such prior to its rounding.
