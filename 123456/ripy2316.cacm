Programming Languages: History and Future
This paper discusses both the history and future
of programming languages (= higher level languages). 
 Some of the difficulties in writing such a history
are indicated.  A key part of the paper is a tree 
showing the chronological development of languages and their
interrelationships.  Reasons for the proliferation 
of languages are given.  The major languages are listed
with the reasons for their importance.  A section 
on chronology indicates the happenings of the significant
previous time periods and the major topics 
of 1972.  Key concepts other than specific languages are discussed.
