AUTOMAST: Automatic Mathematical Analysis and Symbolic Translation
A procedure for numerically solving systems
of ordinary differential equation is shown to also 
generate symbolic solutions.  The procedure is based
on a finite Taylor series expansion that includes 
an estimate of the error in the final result.  A computer
program is described that reads in a system 
of such equations and then generates the expansions
for all of the dependent variables. The expansions 
are determined symbolically, hence any non-numeric parameters
in the original equations are carried automatically 
into the final expansions.  Thus the exact influence
of any parameters on the problem solution can be 
easily displayed.
