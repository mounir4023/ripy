Regular Expression Search Algorithm
A method for locating specific character strings
embedded in character text is described and 
an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler
is discussed.  The compiler accepts a regular 
expression as source language and produces an IBM 7094
program as object language.  The object program 
then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces
a signal every time an embedded string in 
the text matches the given regular expression.  Examples,
problems, and solution are also presented.
