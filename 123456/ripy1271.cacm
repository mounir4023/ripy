Secondary Key Retrieval Using an IBM 7090-1301 System
The secondary key retrieval method involves
the preparation of secondary storage lists from 
primary data records. Search requests are satisfied by
logical operations on appropriate lists, producing 
a complete set of addresses of primary records relevant
to the request.  Experimental results are presented 
and a comparative analysis is given.
