Median Split Trees: A Fast Lookup Technique for Frequently Occuring Keys
Split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  A median split tree (MST) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  Unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an MST is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  Further, an MST
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  A discussion of the 
application of MST's to dictionary lookup for English is
presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques.
