Mechanization of Tedious Algebra-the
e Coefficients of Theoretical Chemistry
A table of formulas for certain integrals
involving Legendre functions has been constructed 
mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations.
 The formulas are all rational algebraic 
expressions in a single variable and were constructed
by a recurrence procedure.  They are of interest 
in molecular quantum chemistry.  Trivial coding techniques
were used to write the relevant programs in 
FORTRAN.  The results were photo composed on a Photon
S-560 system, that was controlled by tapes which 
were punched directly from the computer output, so
avoiding manual keyboarding, transcription errors 
and keyboarded correction.
