TENEX, a Paged Time Sharing System for the PDP-10
TENEX is a new time sharing system implemented
on DEC PDP-10 augmented by special paging hardware 
developed at BBN.  This report specifies a set of goals
which are important for any time sharing system. 
 It describes how the TENEX design and implementation
achieve these goals.  These include specifications 
for a powerful multiprocess large memory virtual machine,
intimate terminal interaction, comprehensive 
uniform file and I/O capabilities, and clean flexible
system structure.  Although the implementation 
described here required some compromise to achieve a
system operational within six months of hardware 
checkout, TENEX has met its major goals and provided
reliable service at several sites and through the 
ARPA network.
