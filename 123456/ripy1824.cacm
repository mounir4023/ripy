APAREL-A Parse-Request Language
APAREL is described: this language is an extension
to an algorithmic language (PL/I) that provides 
the pattern-matching capabilities normally found only
in special purpose languages such as SNOBOL4 and 
TMG.  This capability is provided through parse-requests
stated in a BNF-like format.  These parse-requests 
form their own programming language with special sequencing
rules.  Upon successfully completing a parse-request, 
an associated piece of PL/I code is executed.  This
code has available for use, as normal PL/I strings 
the various pieces (at all levels) of the parse.  It
also has available as normal PL/I variables, the
information concerning which of the various alternatives
were successful.  Convenient facilities for 
multiple input-output streams, the initiation of sequences
of parse-requests as a subroutine, and parse-time 
semantic checks are also included.  APAREL has proven convenient
 in building a powerful SYNTAX and FUNCTION 
macro system, an algebraic language preprocessor debugging
system, an on-line command parser, a translator 
for Dataless Programming, and as a general string manipulator.
