ELIZA-A Computer Program For the Study ofNatural
Language Communication Between Man And Machine
ELIZA is a program operating within the MAC
time-sharing system at MIT which makes certain 
kinds of natural language conversation between man and
computer possible.  Input sentences are analyzed 
on the basis of decomposition rules which are triggered
by key words appearing in the input text.  Responses 
are generated by reassembly rules associated with selected
decomposition rules.  the fundamental technical 
problems with which ELIZA is concerned are: (1)the
identification of key words, (2) the discovery of 
minimal context, (3) the choice of appropriate transformations,
(4) generation of responses in the absence 
of key words, and (5) the provision of an editing capability
for ELIZA "scripts".  A discussion of some 
psychological issues relevant to the ELIZA approach as
well as of future developments concludes the paper.
