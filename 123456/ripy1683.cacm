Boolean matrix Methods for the Detection of Simple Precedence Grammars
A mechanical procedure is derived for determining
whether a given context-free phrase structure 
grammar is a simple precedence grammar.  This procedure
consists of elementary operations on suitably 
defined Boolean matrices.  Application of the
procedure to operator grammars is also given.
