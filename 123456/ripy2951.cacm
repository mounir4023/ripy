Dynamic Response Time Prediction for Computer Networks
If the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  This 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. Analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  The research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for 
the five diverse ARPA network systems studied in detail,
to describe and predict the response time for 
network time-sharing systems as it depends on some
measure of system activity or load level.
