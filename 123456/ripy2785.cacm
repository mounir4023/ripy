Glypnir-A Programming Language for Illiac IV
GLYPNIR is one of the earliest existing languages
designed for programming the Illiac IV computer. 
The syntax of the language is based on ALGOL 60, but has
been extended to allow the programmer explicitly 
to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of 64-word
vectors.  This paper describes the characteristics, 
goals and philosophy of the language, and discusses some
of the problems associated with parallel computer 
architectures.
