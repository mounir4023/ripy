PIP: A Photo-Interpretive Program
for the Analysis of Spark-Chamber Data*
An operating computer program that processes
photographically recorded data is described.  
The input to the program consists of spark-chamber photographs
on which tracks of high-energy particles 
are recorded.  The program automatically scans, measures
and performs the preliminary interpretation 
of these photographs.  In continuous operation a processing
rate of 5,000 photographic frames per hour 
is achieved.
