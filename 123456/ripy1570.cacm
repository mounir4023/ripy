String Processing Techniques
The internal organization of string processing
systems is discussed.  Six techniques for data 
structures are presented and evaluated on the basis of:
(1) creation of strings; (2) examination of strings; 
and (3) alteration of strings.  Speed of operation, storage
requirements, effect on paging, and programmer 
convenience are also considered.  One of the techniques,
single-word linked blocks, is used in an example 
demonstrating an implementation of a SNOBOL string
processing language on an IBM System/360.
