A List-Type Storage Technique for Alphameric Information
A method which is economic in terms of space and
time is proposed for the storage and manipulation 
of character strings of arbitrary length in a fixed
word-length computer.  The method is illustrated 
in an application to Algol-type identifiers in an Algol-like block structure.
