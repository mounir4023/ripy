The Reallocation of Hash-Coded Tables
When the space allocation for a hash-coded table
is altered, the table entries must be rescattered 
over the new space.  A technique for accomplishing
this rescattering is presented.  The technique is 
independent of both the length of the table and the hashing
function used, and can be utilized in conjunction 
with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered.
 Moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously 
flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to change
from one hashing method to another.  The efficiency 
of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given.
