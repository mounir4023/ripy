A Dispersion Pass Algorithm for the Polyphase Merge
This paper presents a new manner of dispersing
strings for a Polyphase merge.  If the number 
of strings dispersed is between two levels acceptable
by Polyphase merge, a more economical technique 
of reaching the next level for Polyphase merge is shown and proved.
