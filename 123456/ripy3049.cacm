A Simply Extended and Modified Batch
Environment Graphical System (SEMBEGS)
SEMBEGS is a complete batch environment graphical
system containing components for handling 
graphical data files, for displaying the contents of
these files on a variety of graphical hardware, 
and for performing graphical batch input operations.
 SEMBEGS is easy to extend and modify to meet the 
growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even
extendable to a fully interactive system.  The 
paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading
to the design of SEMBEGS and outlines the major 
components of the system.  The design of SEMBEGS is founded
upon the basic assumption that the true aim 
of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities,
rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical 
input and output functional capabilities.  SEMBEGS
is built around a Basic Graphical Data Management 
System (BAGDAMS) which provides a common means of communicating
the descriptions of graphical entities 
 between the various components of SEMBEGS.  BAGDAMS
provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and 
manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities
provided by, and received by application programs,
graphics packages, and graphical devices.
