Right Brother Trees
Insertion and deletion are provided for the
class of right (or one-sided) brother trees which 
have O (log n) performance.  The importance of these
results stems from the close relationship of right 
brother trees which have an insertion algorithm operating
in O (log2 n).  Further, although both insertion 
and deletion can be  carried out in O (log n) time for
right brother trees, it appears that the insertion 
algorithm is inherently much more difficult than the
deletion algorithm-the reverse of what one usually 
obtains.
