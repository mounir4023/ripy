A Psychology of Learning BASIC
This paper addresses the question: What does a person know
following learning of BASIC programming?  Several underlying conceptual
structures are identified: (1) a transaction is an event that
occurs in the computer and involves some operation on some object
at some location, (2) a prestatement is a set of transactions corresponding
to a line of code, (3) chunks are frequently occurring
 configurations of prestatements corresponding to several lines of code.
