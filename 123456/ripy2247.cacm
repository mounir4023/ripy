On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules
This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism
for improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility 
of a system while allowing the shortening of its development
time.  The effectiveness of a "modularization" 
is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the
system into modules.  A system design problem is
presented and both a conventional and unconventional
decomposition are described.  It is shown that the 
unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages
for the goals outlined.  The criteria used in 
arriving at the decompositions are discussed.  The
unconventional decomposition, if implemented with 
the conventional assumption that a module consists of
one or more subroutines, will be less efficient 
in most cases.  An alternative approach to implementation
which does not have this effect is sketched.
