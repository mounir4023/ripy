Graphical Input/Output of Nonstandard Characters
A system developed at Harvard for graphically
inputting and outputting nonstandard characters 
on a computer is printed.  In principle, the system
can deal with any orthography, although at present 
it is limited to 4000 Chinese characters and some mathematical
symbols.  New characters can be added 
to the repertoire of the system by graphical input on
a display scope.  Text inputting is accomplished 
via a display scope or a Rand Tablet.  The organization
and operation of the current system are described, 
and a discussion of the relative merits of such a system
is given.  Illustrations of the computer input 
and output of Chinese characters are included.
