Operating System Performance
An overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given.  While a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  Because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 Such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.
