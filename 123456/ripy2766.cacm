Copying Cyclic List Structures in Linear Time Using Bounded Workspace
A bounded workspace copying algorithm for arbitrary
list structures is given.  This algorithm 
operates in linear time and does not require tag bits. 
The best previous bounded workspace copying algorithms 
achieved n^2 time without tag bits and n log n time with
one tag.  The only restriction on the algorithm 
given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguous
section of memory.  The method is applicable 
to fixed or variable size nodes.
