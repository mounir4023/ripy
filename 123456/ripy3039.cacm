On-the-Fly Garbage Collection: An Exercise in Cooperation
As an example of cooperation between sequential
processes with very little mutual interference 
despite frequent manipulations of a large shared data
space,  a technique is developed which allows nearly 
all of the activity needed for garbage detection and collection
to be performed by an additional processor 
operating con-currently with the processor devoted to the
computation proper.  Exclusion and synchronization 
constraints have been kept as weak as could be achieved;
the severe complexities engendered by doing 
so are illustrated.
