The Design and Implementation of a Table Driven,
Interactive Diagnostic Programming System
CAPS is a highly interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreter
that allows beginning programmers 
to prepare, debug, and execute fairly simple programs
at a graphics display terminal.  Complete syntax 
checking and most semantic analysis is performed as
the program is entered and as it is subsequently
edited.  Analysis is performed character by character.
 The most remarkable feature of CAPS is its ability 
to automatically diagnose errors both at compile time
and at run time.  Errors are not automatically 
corrected.  Instead, CAPS interacts with the student to help
him find the cause of his error.  Most components 
of CAPS are table driven, both to reduce the space needed
for implementation and to increase the flexibility 
of the multilingual system.  Over 500 students have used
CAPS to learn Fortran, PL/I, or Cobolin conjunction 
with a computer assisted course on introductory computer science.
