A Program Data Flow Analysis Procedure
The global data relationships in a program
can be exposed and codified by the static analysis 
methods described in this paper.  A procedure is given
which determines all the definitions which can
possibly "reach" each node of the control flow graph
of the program and all the definitions that are 
"live" on each edge of the graph.  The procedure uses
an "interval" ordered edge listing data structure 
and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably.
