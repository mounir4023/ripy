A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System Performance
The continually increasing size, complexity,
number of types, and cost of data processing systems 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance.  Real-time data processing systems 
as typified by the automated airline reservation system
are discussed in this paper.  Criteria for evaluating 
performance are described; a methodology for calculating
and optimizing is outlined; and the method is 
illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performance
calculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented 
message switching system.
