Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Parallel Computer
Two algorithms are presented for sorting n^2
elements on an n X n mesh-connected processor 
array that require O(n) routing and comparison steps.
 The best previous algorithm takes time O(n log 
n).  The algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimal
in time within small constant factors.  Extensions 
to higher-dimensional arrays are also given.
