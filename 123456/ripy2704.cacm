Exception Handling: Issues and a Proposed Notation
This paper defines exception conditions, discusses
the requirements exception handling language 
features must satisfy, and proposes some new language
features for dealing with exceptions in an orderly 
and reliable way.  The proposed language features serve
to highlight exception handling issues by showing 
how deficiencies in current approaches can be remedied.
