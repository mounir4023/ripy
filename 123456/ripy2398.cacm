Teacher/Student Authored CAI Using the NEWBASIC System
The pedagogical advantages of a general purpose
interactive system called NEWBASIC/CATALYST 
are discussed.  NEWBASIC/CATALYSTincorporates an advanced
implementation of BASIC, system-level interactive 
features, and a general capability for extension through
user oriented function attachment,  Application 
of this last feature to provide a flexible CAI scan capability
is illustrated.  An example of interaction 
at the system level shows how students can mix the advantages
of independent or "solo" mode computing 
with those of guided or "dual" mode interaction.  Preliminary
experience with the system in an urban 
secondary school setting is discussed.
