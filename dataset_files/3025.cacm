The Evolution of the DEC system 10
The DEC system 10, also known as the PDP-10, evolved
from the PDP-6 (circa 1963) over five generations 
of implementations to presently include systems covering
a price range of five to one.  The origin and 
evolution of the hardware, operating system, and languages
are described in terms of technological change, 
user requirements, and user developments. The PDP-10's
contributions to computing technology include: 
accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time
sharing computing systems; transferring hardware 
technology within DEC (and elsewhere) to minicomputer
design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer 
hardware and software development; and serving as a
model for single user and timeshared interactive 
minicomputer/microcomputer systems.
