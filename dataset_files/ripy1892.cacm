Degree of Multiprogramming in Page-on-Demand Systems
A simple stochastic model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship 
between the number of programs permitted to share memory
(the degree of multiprogramming), drum traffic 
rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,
multiprogrammed, time-shared computer 
systems.  The model preserves, as a key feature, the
property of page-demand statistics which implies 
a "burst" of page demands at the beginning of any job
or quantum execution.  The model, a Markov chain, 
is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically
for a wide range of key environment-descriptive 
parameters.  Implications of the results to time-shared
system design and programming are discussed, 
and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming
for a wide range of parameters is presented 
graphically.
