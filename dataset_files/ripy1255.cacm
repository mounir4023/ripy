A Method of Data List Processing With Application to EEG Analysis
A set of subroutines is discussed, which is
designed to aid in the programming of computations 
on indexed lists of numbers using machine language
or a symbolic assembly system.  The most commonly 
performed list operations are outlined, and logically
arranged into five groups.  As an example, the 
computation of power spectral density from the autocovariance
function is discussed for a class of EEG 
signals.
