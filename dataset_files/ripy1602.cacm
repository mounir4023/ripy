POSE: A Language for Posing Problems to a Computer
A language, POSE, is described which is a drastic
departure from the FORTRAN/ALGOL type, though 
it does utilize FORTRAN formula and logic representations
(and actually contains FORTRAN VI as a subset). 
 With the new language, the user need only describe
his problem in "equation-like" form. The method 
of solution is automatically provided in conjunction
with the translation from equation form to computer 
instruction. In this way the POSE language user can
solve difficult computational problems (like the 
solution of differential equation) without requiring
a knowledge of numerical methods or the intricacies 
of computer subroutine logic. Essentially all clerical
operations now required for FORTRAN programming 
have been automated so that the POSE programmer
need not be concerned with these details.
