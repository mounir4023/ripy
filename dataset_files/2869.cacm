Security Kernel Validation in Practice
A security kernel is a software and hardware
mechanism that enforces access controls within 
a computer system. The correctness of a security kernel
on a PDP-11/45 is being proved.  This paper describes 
the technique used to carry out the first step of the
proof: validating a formal specification of the 
program with respect to a axioms for a secure system.
