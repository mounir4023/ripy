Partial Step Integration
A partial step integration equation is derived
for use with the Adams or Adams-Bashforth method 
of integration of differential equations.  This method
of obtaining functional values at points intermediate 
to the integration points yields accuracy comparable
to the integration and does not require storing 
of additional information as in interpolation methods.
