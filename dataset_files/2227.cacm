Proof of a Program: FIND
A proof is given of the correctness of the
algorithm "Find."  First, a informal description 
is given of the purpose of the program and the method
used.  A systematic technique is described for 
constructing the program proof during the process of coding
it, in such a way as to prevent the intrusion 
of logical errors.  The proof of termination is treated
as a separate exercise.  Finally, some conclusions 
relating to general programming methodology are drawn.
