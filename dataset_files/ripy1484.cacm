A Language for Describing the Functions of Synchronous Systems* 
Before the design of a system is started, the
exact function desired of it should be specified. 
 It is suggested that a computer-oriented language be
used for this purpose.  The inadequacies of the 
standard programming languages for the description of
systems are discussed, and a dialect of ALGOL which 
is suitable for describing synchronous systems is introduced.
 These descriptions can be used for simulation 
and automatic design of the system described, in
addition to communicating system specifications.
