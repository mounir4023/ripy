Improving Locality by Critical Working Sets
A new approach to program locality improvement
via restructuring is described.  The method 
is particularly suited to those systems where primary memory
is managed according to a working set strategy. 
 It is based on the concept of critical working set, a
working set which does not contain the next memory 
reference.  The data the method operates upon are extracted from
a trace of the program to be restructured. 
 It is shown that, except in some special cases, the
method is not optimum.  However, the experimental 
results obtained by using the method to restructure an
interactive text editor and the file system module 
of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority
over the other methods proposed in the 
literature.
