Reducing the Retrieval Time of Scatter Storage Techniques
A new method for entering and retrieving information
in a hash table is described.  The method 
is intended to be efficient if most entries are looked
up several times.  The expected number of probes 
to look up an entry, predicted theoretically and verified
by Monte Carlo experiments, is considerably 
less than for other comparable methods if the table
is nearly full.  An example of a possible Fortran 
implementation is given.
