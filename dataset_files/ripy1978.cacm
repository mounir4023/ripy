The Use of Interactive Graphics To Solve Numerical Problems
With the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer systems
and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities.  Rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  Several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations.  The advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.
In this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines.  Furthermore,
an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting
program, PEG, is presented with results obtained from empirical
data.  In conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed.
