A Futures Market in Computer time
An auction method is described for allocating
computer time that allows the price of computer 
time to fluctuate with the demand and the relative priority
of users to be controlled so that more important 
projects get better access.  This auction is free of the
periodic fluctuation in computer use often associated 
with monthly time allocation schemes.
