A Terminal-Oriented Communication System
This paper describes a system for full-duplex
communication between a time-shared computer 
and its terminals.  The system consists of a communications
computer directly connected to the time-shared 
system, a number of small remote computers to which
the terminals are attached, and connecting medium 
speed telephone lines.  It can service a large number
of terminals of various types.  The overall system 
design is presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems: local echoing, error 
detection and correction on the telephone lines,
and multiplexing of character output.
