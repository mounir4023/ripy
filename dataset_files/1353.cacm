Techniques for Automatic Tolerance Control in Linear Programming
In this technical note, the numerical steps
for the simplex method of linear programming are 
reviewed and the tolerances needed in the numerical procedure
are defined.  Objective criteria are given 
for accomplishing the numerical steps of the method
and the calculation of necessary tolerances.
