Blocks-A New Data type for SNOBOL4
A new data type, called a block, has been implemented
for SNOBOL4.  A block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (The third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  Blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  Some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  Blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  A variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  In addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  The concept of a block is largely
language independent.That is, blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of 
most programming languages.
