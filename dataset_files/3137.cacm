A Methodology for the Design of Distributed Information Systems
A macro model of a distributed information system in presented.  The model
describes the major costs of using an information
system from the perspective of the end-user.  The making evident the effect of
various design and operating parameters on overall cost per transaction.
 The technique is illustrated by application to the design
of an interactive transaction processing system.
