Design and Implementation of a Diagnostic Compiler for PL/I
PL/C is a compiler for a dialect for PL/I.  The
design objective was to provide a maximum degree 
of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment.
 For the most part this assistance is implicit 
and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable
characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance-it 
completes translation of every program submitted and
continues execution until a user-established error 
limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair
errors encountered during both translation 
and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by
this consideration.  PL/C also introduces several 
explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing.
 To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without 
abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits
"pseudo comments"-constructions whose contents 
can optionally be considered either source test or comment.
 In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is 
a fast and efficient processor.  It effectively demonstrates
that compilers can provide better diagnostic 
assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated
source language is employed, and that 
this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.
