On Compiling Algorithms for Arithmetic Expressions
This paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmetic
expressions used in a FORTRAN IV compiler 
for a HITAC-5020 computer having n accumulators.  The
algorithms generate an object code which minimizes 
the frequency of storing and recovering the partial results
of the arithmetic expressions in cases where 
there are several accumulators.
