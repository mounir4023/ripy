The Technology of Computer Center Management: A
Proposed Course for Graduate Professional Programs 
in Computer Science or in Information Systems
McFarlan and Nolan have made a strong case for
adding a course on information systems administration 
to the 13 courses proposed by the ACM Curriculum Committee
on Computer Education for Management for Graduate 
Professional Programs in Information Systems.  This paper
is a report on a course entitled, "The Technology 
of Computer Center Management," which has been offered
at Purdue for the past four years.  The course 
is suitable either for graduate professional programs
in information systems or for graduate professional 
programs in computer science.
