A Process for the Determination of
Addresses in Variable Length Addressing
An algorithm is presented for the assignment
of instruction addresses and formats under the 
following conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies
as a function of the distance of the instruction 
from its target; (2) there exists an optimality criterion
which implies some preferential choices subject 
to the addressing constraints.  This may be, for example,
achieving the smallest number of long instructions, 
in which case the total code length is minimized, or
minimizing the assigned address of a specified point 
in the program.  The algorithm is suitable for arbitrary
program structure and a choice of optimization 
criteria.
