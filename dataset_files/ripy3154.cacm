Algorithm = Logic + Control
An algorithm can be regarded as consisting of a logic component,
which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems,
and a control component, which determines the problem-solving
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used.  The logic component
determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control
component only affects its efficiency.  The efficiency of an
algorithm can often by improving the control component without changing
the logic of the algorithm.  We argue that computer programs would
be more often correct and more easily improved and modified if
their logic and control aspects were identified and separated in
the program text.
