Logic and Semantic Networks
An extended form of semantic network is defined, which can
be regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic.
By virtue of its relationship with logic, the extended
semantic network is provided with a precise semantics,
inference rules, and a procedural interpretation.  On
the other hand, by regarding semantic networks as an 
abstract data structure for the representation of clauses, we provide a
theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following
strategy for guiding the search for a proof.
