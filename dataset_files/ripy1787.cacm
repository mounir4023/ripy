Use of Transition Matrices in Compiling
An algorithms is described which constructs
from a suitable BNF grammar an efficient left-right 
recognizer for sentences of the corresponding language.
 The type of recognizer, used in a number of 
compilers, operates with a pushdown stack and with
a transition matrix.  Two examples illustrate how 
such recognizers may be used effectively for other
purposes besides the usual syntax checking.
