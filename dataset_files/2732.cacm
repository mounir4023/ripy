Guarded Commands, Nondeterminacy and Formal Derivation of Programs
So-called "guarded commands" are introduced
as a building block for alternative and repetitive 
constructs that allow nondeterministic program components
for which at least the activity evoked, but 
possible even the final state, is not necessarily uniquely
determined by the initial state.  For the 
formal derivation of programs expressed in terms
of these constructs, a calculus will be shown.
