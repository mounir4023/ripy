Price/Performance Patterns of U.S. Computer Systems
Econometric models of the U.S. computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between system price and hardware performance.  Single
measures of price/performance such as "Grosch's Law" are shown to
be so over simplified as to be meaningless.  Multiple-regression models
predicting system cost as a function of several hardware
characteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy.  On one hand there
exists a stable, price predictable market for larger, general
purpose computer systems.  The other market is the developing one
for small business computer systems, a market which is relatively
unstable with low price predictability.
