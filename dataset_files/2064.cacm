Operations on Generalized Arrays with the Genie Compiler
Operations on vectors, matrices, and higher dimensional storage arrays are 
standard features of most compilers today.  The elements of such structures are
usually restricted to be scalars.  For many sophisticated applications
this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations.
An efficient system has been devised and implemented which allows
the elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional
arrays.  This system was developed from a storage structure
in which the location, length, and content of each array is described
by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system.  Code words may describe 
arrays containing more codewords, thus providing
all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form.
