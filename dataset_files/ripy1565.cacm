A Language-Independent Macro Processor
A macro processor is described which can be
used with almost any source language.  It provides 
all features normally associated with a macro facility,
plus the ability to make arbitrary transformations 
of the argument strings.  The program is used at the
Basser Computing Department, University of Sydney, 
Sydney, Australia, to process text for eight different compilers.
