Policy, Values, and EFT Research: Anatomy of a Research Agenda
There is an emerging recognition that EFT systems have the potential to
vastly alter the payment and fund transfer system in American society.
A number of forces and actors are involved in this evolution,
and the values vary significantly depending on individual and institutional 
perspectives. These value conflicts are highlighted
in a six-part research agenda: technological issues in EFT, EFT impacts 
on people, economic impact of EFT, regulation and control of
EFT, and evaluating and monitoring EFT systems.
