Two Hadamard Numbers for Matrices
A discussion is given of two functions of the entries
of a square matrix, both related to Hadamard's 
determinant theorem, which have some merits as alternatives
to norm-bound "condition numbers."  One (for 
linear systems) is known; the other (for eigen systems) seems to be new.
