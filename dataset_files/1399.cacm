On Top-to-Bottom Recognition and Left Recursion
A procedure is given for obtaining structural
descriptions in a context-free grammar by performing 
the recognition according to a strongly equivalent, 
left-recursion-freegrammar. The effect of allowing 
null strings in the rewriting rules is discussed.
