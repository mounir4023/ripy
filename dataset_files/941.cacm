A Recursive Program for the General n-Dimensional Integral
A general program is outlined for n-dimensional
integration with variable limits.  The program 
is of a recursive nature and uses Simpson's rule combined
with repeated bisection to attain the required 
accuracy.  It was developed in the Ferranti Mercury Autocode Scheme.
