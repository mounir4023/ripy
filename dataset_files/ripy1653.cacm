System Performance Evaluation: Survey and Appraisal
The state of the art of system performance
evaluation is reviewed and evaluation goals and 
problems are examined.  Throughput, turnaround, and
availability are defined as fundamental measures 
of performance; overhead and CPU speed are placed in
perspective.  The appropriateness of instruction 
mixes, kernels, simulators, and other tools is discussed,
as well as pitfalls which may be encountered 
when using them.  Analysis, simulation, and synthesis are
presented as three levels of approach to evaluation, 
requiring successively greater amounts of information.
 The central role of measurement in performance 
evaluation and in the development of evaluation methods is explored.
