The Stability of the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta
Method for the Solution of Systems of Differential 
Equations
The problem of the region of stability of the
fourth order-Runge-Kutta method for the solution 
of systems of differential equations is studied.  This
region can be characterized by means of linear 
transformation but can not be given in a closed form.
 In the paper, this region is determined by the 
electronic digital computer Z22.
