Operations on Sparse Relations
Various computations on relations, Boolean matrices,
or directed graphs, such as the computation 
of precedence relations for a context-free grammar, can be
done by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically 
faster than those in common use.  For example, how to compute
operator precedence or Wirth-Weber precedence 
relations in O(n^2) steps is shown, as well as how to
compute linear precedence functions in O(n^2) steps 
is shown, as well as how to compute linear precedence
functions in O(n) steps, where n is the size of 
a grammer.  The heart of the algorithms is a general
theorem giving sufficient conditions under which 
an expression whose operands are sparse relations and
whose operators are composition, transitive closure, 
union, and inverse, can be computed efficiently.
