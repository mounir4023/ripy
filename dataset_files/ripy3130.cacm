Undergraduate Program in Computer Science
Contained in this report are the recommendations for
the undergraduate degree program in Computer Science of the
Curriculum Committee on Computer Science (C3S) of the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM).   The core curriculum common to all
computer science undergraduate programs is presented in terms of
elementary level topics and courses, and intermediate level courses.
Elective courses, used to round out an undergraduate program,
are then discussed, and the entire program including the computer
science component and other material is presented.  Issues related
to undergraduate computer science education, such as service
courses, supporting areas, continuing education, facilities,
