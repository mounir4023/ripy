File-Handling Within FORTRAN
This note describes some FORTRAN subroutines
to facilitate handling of tape files.  They allow 
symbolic naming of information files, without violating
the casual scientific programmer's idea of simplicity. 
 Some comments on two years use of these subroutines are given.
