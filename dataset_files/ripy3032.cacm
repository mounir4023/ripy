Reverse Path Forwarding of Broadcast Packets
A broadcast packet is for delivery to all
nodes of a network.  Algorithms for accomplishing 
this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching
 computer network include (1) transmission 
of separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination
addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding,(4) spanning 
tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding.  To
this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  Reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity
than that required for the known alternatives.
