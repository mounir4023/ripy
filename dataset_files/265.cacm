Low Level Language Subroutines for Use Within Fortran
This paper describes some subroutines, coded
in symbolic languages and for use within Fortran 
coded programs, to deal with "special arithmetic" (e.g.
multi-precision arithmetic), symbol manipulation, 
bit manipulation and expanded character set input-output, and visual display.
