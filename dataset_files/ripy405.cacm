An Algorithm for Coding Efficient Arithmetic Operations
Most existing formula translation schemes
yield inefficient coding.  A method is described 
which reduces the number of store and fetch operations,
evaluates constant subexpressions during compilation, 
and recognizes many equivalent subexpressions.
