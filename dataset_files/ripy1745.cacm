A Position Paper on Computing and Communications
The effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security.
