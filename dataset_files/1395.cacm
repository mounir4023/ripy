On the Implementation of AMBIT, A Language for Symbol Manipulation
A brief description is given of the implementation
technique for the replacement rule of the 
AMBIT programming language.  The algorithm for the "AMBIT
scan" and an example of its application are 
given.  The algorithm is applicable to other members
of the family of string transformation languages 
of which AMBIT is a member, and it provides a rationale
for the design of the AMBIT language.
