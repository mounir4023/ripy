A Class of Dynamic Memory Allocation Algorithms
Anew dynamic memory allocation algorithm, the
Fibonacci system, is introduced.  This algorithm 
is similar to, but seems to have certain advantages over,
the "buddy" system.  A generalization is mentioned 
which includes both of these systems as special cases.
