Easy English,a Language for Information
Retrieval Through a Remote Typewriter Console
Easy English is a natural command language
designed to simplify communication between man and 
machine through remote typewriter console.  It has been developed
for retrieval of documents from a computerized 
data base, the Moore School Information Systems Laboratory
files.  Requests are formulated in a standardized 
syntactical form (examples of which are presented), and
this form is then transformed into an equivalent 
query expressed in the retrieval system's original Symbolic
Command Language, which is briefly described. 
 Operation of easy English is detailed by illustration
of the transformations performed upon a sample 
request up to the point at which the request string
is sent to the system.  A macro flowchart of Easy 
English is included, and an Appendix provides
the printout of a retrieval demonstration.
