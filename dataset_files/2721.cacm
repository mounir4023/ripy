The Digital Simulation of River Plankton Population Dynamics
This paper deals with the development of a
mathematical model for and the digital simulation 
in Fortran IV of phytoplankton and zooplankton population
densities in a river using previously developed 
rate expressions.  In order to study the relationships
between the ecological mechanisms involved, the 
simulation parameters were varied illustrating the
response of the ecosystem to different conditions, 
including those corresponding to certain types of chemical
and thermal pollution.  As an investigation 
of the accuracy of the simulation methods, a simulation
of the actual population dynamics of Asterionella 
in the Columbia River was made based on approximations
of conditions in that river. Although not totally 
accurate, the simulation was found to predict the general
annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well 
and, specifically, revealed the importance of the annual
velocity cycle in determining such patterns. 
 In addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of
digital simulations in the examinations of certain 
aquatic ecosystems, as well as in environmental
planning involving such examinations.
