   MANIP: A Computer System for Algebra and Analytic Differentiation
   A mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in FORTRAN-like 
notation and stored in the computer as a string of BCD characters with all
blanks removed. It may be as complicated as desired (parentheses nested without
restriction, etc.) so long as the entire expression (or any subsequent form)
does not exceed 5000 characters. The problemm of performing algebraic operations
and obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying and
manipulating character sequences. Programs which resulted were written in
FORTRAN IV for a CDC 3600 and are discussed in detail.
