A Proposal for a Computer-Based Interactive Scientific Community
Because of the problems created by the explosion
of papers in the mathematical sciences and 
the drawbacks that this places on research, it is suggested
that a tree of all mathematical results and 
terminology be maintained in a multiterminal computer system.
 Users of the system can store in the computer 
an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selecting
a paper to read, they can obtain from the 
computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring
them from what they already know to the background 
knowledge which the paper assumes.  Under certain conditions,
means are also provided for the contribution 
of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interaction
between commentators and with the author. 
 This paper describes how the system can be organized
and the role required of readers, writers, and 
commentators.
