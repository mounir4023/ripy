An ALGOL-like Computer Design Language
The idea of constructing a computer design
language by making use of an ALGOL-like programming 
language is presented.  A computer designer can benefit
from using a design language at a higher level 
just as a computer user can benefit from a higher level
programming language.  The purposes and requirements 
of the design language are enumerated.  To achieve most
of the purposes a translator is required to translate 
a design of computer logic into a set of Boolean equations.
 The design language is presented in terms 
of vocabulary, statements, sequences and microprogram.
 Included are examples of identifiers, expressions 
with both unary and binary operators, declaration statements,
transfer statements, terminal statements, 
exchange statements, if statements, do statements, go
to statements, several sequences and a microprogram.
