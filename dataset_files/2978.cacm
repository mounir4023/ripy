Analysis of Design Alternatives for Virtual Memory Indexes
A class of index structures for use in a virtual
memory environment is described.  Design alternatives 
within this class of index structures are analyzed.  These
alternatives include a choice of search strategy, 
whether or not pages in the index are structured, and
whether or not keys are compressed.  The average 
cost of retrieving entries from these indexes is expressed
as a wieghted sum of the cost of a basic key 
comparison and the cost of crossing a page boundary in
the index structure.  Formulas for the retrieval 
costs for possible combinations of design alternatives
are given.  These are used in numerical case studies 
which compare the retrieval costs of the alternatives.
 Qualitative comparisons of the main tenance costs 
(insertion, deletion, reorganization) of the
design alternatives are also included.
