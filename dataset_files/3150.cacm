Beyond Programming Languages
As computer technology matures, our growing ability to create large systems is 
leading to basic changes in the nature of programming.  Current programming 
language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintaining
systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt.  Just
as high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from the
intricacies of a machine's order code, higher level programming systems
can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex
systems and components.  In order to develop such systems, we need
to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of
algorithms, towards the description of the properties of the packages
and objects with which we build.  This paper analyzes some of the
shortcomings of programming languages as they now exist,
and lays out some possible directions for future research.
