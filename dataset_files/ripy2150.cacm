Concurrent Control with "Readers" and "Writers"
The problem of the mutual exclusion of several
independent processes from simultaneous access 
to a "critical section" is discussed for the case where
there are two distinct classes of processes known 
as "readers" and "writers."  The "readers" may share
the section with each other, but the "writers" must 
have exclusive access.  Two solutions are presented:
one of the case where we wish minimum delay for 
the readers; the other for the case where we wish
writing to take place as early as possible.
