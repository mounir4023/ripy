An Efficient Bit Table Technique for Dynamic
Storage Allocation of 2^n-word Blocks
An efficient bit table technique for dynamic storage
allocation of 2^n-word blocks, which requires 
a minimized amount of memory for bookkeeping purposes,
is described. The technique has been tested in 
an implementation of the list processing language L^6.
 A number of ideas incorporated in the processor 
are also described.
