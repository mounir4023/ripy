   ALGEM - An Algebraic Manipulator
   ALGEM is a package of subprograms written in Slip, FORTRAN IV and MAP 7094 
II to manipulate algebraic expressions. Algem's basic algebraic operations are 
additions, subtractions, multiplications, division and exponentiation. It is 
capable of handling any number of single letter variables, variable exponents, 
and of finding the highest common factor of two polynomials. Also included are
such functions as substitution, differentiation, determining coefficients of
specified variables, solving a linear equation, basic I/O routines plus other
special purpose and arithmetic routines. The major innovation of Algem over 
other manipulators is the assignment of types to all expressions and the use 
of a standard ordering procedure.
