Fix point Approach to the Theory of Computation 
Following the fix point theory of Scott, the
semantics of computer programs are defined in terms 
of the least fix points of recursive programs.  This
allows not only the justification of all existing 
verification techniques, but also their extension to the
handling, in a uniform manner of various properties 
of computer programs, including correctness, termination, and equivalence.
