Sorting in a Paging Environment
This sorting study was part of an extensive measurement project
undertaken on the M44/44X, an experimental paging system which was
conceived and implemented at IBM Research in order to explore the
virtual machine concept.  The study was concerned with the implementation 
of sorting procedures in the context of the dynamic paging
environment characteristic of virtual memory machines.  Descriptions of 
the experimental sort programs and analysis of the performance
measurement results obtained for them are presented. The insight gained 
from the experimental effort is used to arrive at a set of
broad guidelines for writing sort programs for a paging environment.
