A Model for Verification of Data Security in Operating Systems
Program verification applied to kernel architectures
forms a promising method for providing 
uncircumventably secure, shared computer systems.  A
precise definition of data security is developed 
here in terms of a general model for operating systems.
 This model is suitable as a basis for verifying 
many of those properties of an operating system which
are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of 
security.  The application of this approach to the
UCLA secure operating system is also discussed.
