An Algorithm for Solving a Special Class
of Tridiagonal Systems of Linear Equations
An algorithm is presented for solving a system
of linear equation Bu=k where B is tridiagonal 
and of a special form.  It is shown that this algorithm
is almost twice as fast as the Gaussian elimination 
method usually suggested for solving such systems. 
In addition, explicit formulas for the inverse and 
determinant of the matrix B are given.
