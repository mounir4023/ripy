The MAD Definition Facility
One of the first definition facilities for
higher level languages is described.  Users of the 
language can define new operators and/or data types
into the MAD language, so that their use appears 
as if they were predefined.  Information is given on
how one writes definitions, as well as on much of 
the motivation behind the form in which definitions are
written. Some conclusions are drawn about future 
definitional facilities.
