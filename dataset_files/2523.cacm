A Region Coloring Technique for Scene Analysis
A method of converting a picture into a "cartoon"
or "map" whose regions correspond to differently 
textured regions is described.  Texture edges in the
picture are detected, and solid regions surrounded 
by these (usually broken) edges are "colored in" using
a propagation process.  The resulting map is cleaned 
by comparing the region colors with the textures of
the corresponding regions in the picture, and also 
by merging some regions with others according to criteria
based on topology and size.  The method has 
been applied to the construction of cloud cover maps
from cloud cover pictures obtained by satellites.
