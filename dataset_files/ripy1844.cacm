A Modular Computer Sharing System
An alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  The system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  One of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  In the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 Thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 This system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.
