Parallel Numerical Methods for the Solution of Equations
Classical iterative procedures for the numerical
solution of equations provide at each stage 
a single new approximation to the root in question.  A
technique is given for the development of numerical 
procedures which provide, at each stage, several approximations
to a solution of an equation.  The s8everal 
approximations obtained in any iteration are computationally
independent, making the methods of interest 
in a parallel processing environment.  Convergence is
insured by extracting the "best information" at 
each iteration.  Several families of numerical procedures
which use the technique of the procedures in 
a parallel processing environment are developed and measurements
of these statistics are reported.  These 
measurements are interpreted in a parallel processing
environment.  In such an environment the procedures 
obtained are superior to standard algorithms.
