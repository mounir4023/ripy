The Eschenbach Drum Scheme
The prime function of a drum, operating in
real time, is to perform accesses quickly.  The 
usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
engineering or hardware improvements.  In 
this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the
drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which 
it operates.  At the outset, a drum is given a functional
definition.  Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) 
is introduced which enormously increases the rate of
accessing for drums so defined.  This is shown to 
enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or
less expensive drums.  It is suggested that although 
the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it
has more general applicability.  The question 
of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised.  To
deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed 
in light of realistic real-time circumstances.  The drum
scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits 
it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. 
Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum 
scheme is efficient enough for its application.  Again,
whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a 
specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability.
