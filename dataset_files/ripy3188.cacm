   Semiotics and Programming Languages
   I have based my paper on semiotics and its three dimension. I should insert
at this point that language has many aspects and that pragmatics, semantics and
syntactics do not necessary cover all of them. One can, however, project most 
aspects into the three semiotic dimension and there seems to be a strong 
tendency to do so today.
