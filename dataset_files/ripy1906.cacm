Automated Printed Circuit Routing with a Stepping Aperture
A computer program for routing interconnections
on a two-sided printed circuit board with a 
regular pattern of lines, pins (terminals), and vias
(feed-through holes) is described.  In this program, 
each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically,
down from the upper pin, through a via, and 
horizontally to the lower pin.  From the top, a virtual
aperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped 
down the board.  The planned routing is the basis for
rerouting interconnections within the aperture 
to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture
and to maximize the effective line usage. 
 If a conflict has not been resolved before the aperture
arrives at the lower pin,interconnections are 
deleted to resolve the conflict.  Extensions of this technique
to the control of crosstalk between routed 
interconnections and to the problem of obtaining
100 percent interconnect are also discussed.
