Further Analysis of a Computing Center Environment
Empirical distributions of program lengths,
execution times, processing times, and loading 
times of over 10,000 jobs serviced in a university computing
center environment are presented.  The data 
are subdivided according to certain characteristics of users
and jobs to obtain selected empirical conditional 
distributions of those time properties as well as statistical
measures of other interesting properties. 
 The results are interpreted in terms of the properties of the system studied.
