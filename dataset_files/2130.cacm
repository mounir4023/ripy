Automatic Segmentation of Cyclic Program Structures
Based on Connectivity and Processor Timing
Time-shared, multiprogrammed, and overlayed batch systems frequently
require segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions.  
These program portions are transferred between executable and
peripheral storage whenever necessary; segmentation of program
s in a manner that  reduces the frequency of such transfers is the
subject of this paper.  Segmentation techniques proposed by C. V.
Ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferred
segment size is not compatible with the physical restrictions
imposed by the available computing equipment.  A generalization of
Ramamoorthy's suggestions is made in order to allow their application 
when circumstances are other than ideal.
