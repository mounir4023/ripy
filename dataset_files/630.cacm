An Evaluation of Autocode Readability
Of the many requirements of an autocode, the
pair of requirements "easy to read" and "easy 
to write" are not often compatible.  This paper argues
that readability can be added automatically in 
the translation process so that the programmer can
enjoy the utmost economy of expression, while for 
management a full and valid COBOL version is printed to give
all the advantages of readability and compatibility.
