Near-Minimax Polynomial Approximations and Partitioning of Intervals
A method of near-minimax polynomial approximation
is described.  As a by-product, this method 
provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum error
associated with a given degree of approximation. 
 Using this formula, a partitioning algorithm is obtained
for dividing a basic interval into subintervals 
for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error.
