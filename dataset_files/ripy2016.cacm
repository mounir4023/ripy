The Instrumentation of Multics
An array of measuring tools devised to aid in the implementation of a prototype
computer utility is discussed.  These tools include special hardware
clocks and data channels, general purpose programmed probing
and recording tools, and specialized measurement facilities.  Some
particular measurements of interest in a system which combines demand 
paging with multiprogramming are described in detail.  Where appropriate, 
insight into effectiveness (or lack there of) of individual tools is provided.
