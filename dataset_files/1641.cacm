A Use of Fast and Slow Memories in List-Processing Languages
A scheme is described which permitting a substantial
increase in memory space utilized to store 
list-structured data.  It consists in reducing to one
level a nonhomogeneous store composed of fast (core) 
and slow (disk or drum) memories.  The space available
in slow memory is divided into pages each containing 
a given number of machine words.  The reduction to a
one-level memory is performed by a program which 
leaves the most often called pages in the fast memory.
 When a new page from slow store is requested, 
the page in core having the longest period of inactivity
is transferred back to the slow store.  The 
complete scheme has been implemented in connection with
a LISP embedding into ALGOL, using an IBM 7044 
with 32k of core memory and disks.  Gains in memory space
were about 100-fold.  As often happens in programming 
applications the price of the additional space is computer
time.  Although the disks have an access time 
10^4 times slower than core, tests indicate that the
actual slow down varied from 3 to 10, depending 
on the number of pages available in the fast store.
