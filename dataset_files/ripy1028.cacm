Investigation of a New Analytical Method
for Numerical Derivative Evaluation
A recently proposed analytical approach to
numerical derivative evaluation is discussed.  The 
technique is shown to be both accurate and easy to
apply, though certain indicated modifications are 
required.  Its use should greatly facilitate the writing
and debugging of programs requiring derivatives 
of highly complex functions.
