On the Numerical Solution of Boundary Value Problems
for Linear Ordinary Differential Equations*
A numerical method is presented for the solution
of boundary value problems involving linear 
ordinary differential equations.  The method described
is noniterative and makes use of any one-step 
numerical integration scheme to reduce the problem from
one of boundary values to one of initial values. 
 Comments are made concerning some numerical results
of applying the method to a specific problem.  In 
addition an extension of the algorithm described
to more general problems is discussed.
