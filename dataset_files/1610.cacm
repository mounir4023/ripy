A Method for the Solution of Transportation Problems with Tall Matrices
A method is presented for the solution of the
transportation problem having a cost matrix with 
few columns.  The computer implementation of this method
shows it to be very fast and efficient.  Application 
are indicted for the personnel classification problem
as well as the classical transportation problem. 
 An example is worked out in detail.
