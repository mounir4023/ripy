Scheduling Project Networks
Some of the basic concepts and terminology
of project networking are developed.  The Critical 
Path Algorithm incorporated in the C-E-I-R proprietary
scheduling system RAMPS (Resource Allocation and 
Multi-Project Scheduling) is described.  The error detection
and network analysis features of the algorithm 
are also described.
