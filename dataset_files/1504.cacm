Algorithms for Finding a Fundamental Set
of Cycles for an Undirected Linear Graph
Given the adjacency matrix of the graph, the algorithm
presented in this paper finds a spanning 
tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles.
 Our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented 
by Welch by a ratio of N/3 (N is the number of nodes)
but requires less storage.  For graphs with a large 
number of nodes and edges, when storage is limited our
algorithm is superior to Welch's; however, when 
the graphs are small, or machine storage is very large,
Welch's algorithm is superior.  Timing estimates 
and storage requirements for both methods are presented.
