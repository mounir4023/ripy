Parsing of Decision Tables
Reduction in the size of decision tables can be
accomplished by several techniques.  The techniques 
considered in this paper are on the parsing of decision
tables with regard to horizontal and vertical 
data structures, job identity, hardware and job priorities,
and context relationships.  Such parsing 
rests upon some conventions for the linkage of decision tables.
