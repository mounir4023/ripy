Compact List Representation: Definition,
Garbage Collection, and System Implementation
Compact lists are stored sequentially in memory,
rather than chained with pointers.  Since 
this is not always convenient, the Swym system permits
a list to be chained, compact, or any combination 
of the two.  A description is given of that list representation
and the operators implemented (most are 
similar to those of LISP 1.5).  The system garbage collector
attempts to make all lists compact; it relocates 
and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage.
 This unique list-compacting garbage collection 
algorithm is presented in detail.  Several classes of the
macros used to implement the system are described. 
 Finally, consideration is given to those design factors
essential to the success of a plex processing 
system implementation.
