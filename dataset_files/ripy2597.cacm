Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept
This paper develops Brinch-Hansen's concept of
a monitor as a method of structuring an operating 
system.  It introduces a form of synchronization, describes
a possible method of implementation in terms 
of semaphores and gives a suitable proof rule.  Illustrative
examples include a single resource scheduler, 
a bounded buffer, an alarm clock, a buffer pool, a
disk head optimizer, and a version of the problem 
of readers and writers.
