A Decision Matrix as the Basis for a Simple Data Input Routine
Currently a great deal of time and effort is
being spent on the development of bigger and better 
compiler languages, multiprogram executive systems,
etc.  Since the implementation of  of new methods 
and procedures is not instantaneous, but rather occurs
by an evolutionary process, we should be concerned 
also with the problem of maintaining, improving and
incorporating new ideas into existing systems.  It 
is with this somewhat neglected area that the author is
interested.  A method employing a decision matrix 
is presented for the handling of a standard systems
programming problem,that of providing a data input 
routine.
