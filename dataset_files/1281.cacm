Data Input by Question and Answer
A data input scheme for a time-sharing computer
is described in this paper.  Instead of using
format statements to determine the input, the computer
asks the user for the required values one at a 
time.  The computer converses with the user during the
input process, checks for errors, provides standard 
data, and allows editing of values input.
