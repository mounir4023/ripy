A Formal Semantics for Computer Languages
and its Application In a Compiler-Compiler
A semantic meta-language has been developed
for representing the meanings of statements in 
a large class of computer languages.  This meta-language
has been the basis for construction of an efficient, 
functioning compiler-compiler.  An informal discussion
of the meta-language based on the example of a 
complete translator for a small language is presented.
