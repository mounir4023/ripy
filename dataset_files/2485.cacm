Managing the Computer Resource: A Stage Hypothesis
Based on the study of expenditures for data processing,
a descriptive stage hypothesis is presented. 
 It is suggested that the planning, organizing, and controlling
activities associated with managing the 
computer resource will change in character over a period
of time, and will evolve in patterns roughly 
correlated to four stages of the computer budget: Stage
I (computer acquisition), Stage II (intense system 
development), Stage III (proliferation of controls), and
Stage IV (user/service orientation).  Each stage 
is described and related to individual tasks for managing the computer resource.
