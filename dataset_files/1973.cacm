The Linear Quotient Hash Code
A new method of hash coding is presented and
is shown to possess desirable attributes.  Specifically, the algorithm
is simple, efficient, and exhaustive, while needing little
time per probe and using few probes per lookup.  Performance
data and implementation hints are also given.
