An Online Editor
An online, interactive system for test editing
is described in detail, with remarks on the 
theoretical and experimental justification for its form.
 Emphasis throughout the system is on providing 
maximum convenience and power for the user.  Notable
features are its ability to handle any piece of 
text, the content-searching facility, and the character-by-character
editing operations.  The editor 
can be programmed to a limited extent.
