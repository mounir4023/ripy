On Coordination Reduction and Sentence Analysis
A class of coordination phenomena in natural
languages is considered within the frame work 
of transformational theory.  To account for these phenomena
it is proposed that certain machinery be 
added to the syntactic component of a transformational
grammar. This machinery includes certain rule 
schemata, the conditions under which they are to be
applied, and conditions determining the sequence 
of subtrees on which they are to be performed.  A solution
to the syntactic analysis problem for this 
class of grammars is outlined.  Precise specification
of both the generative procedure of this paper 
and its inverse is given in the form of LISP function definitions.
