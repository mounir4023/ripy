Event Manipulation for Discrete Simulations
Requiring Large Numbers of Events
The event-manipulation system presented here consists of
two major parts.  The first part addresses 
the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiency
when the number of scheduled events grows large. 
 The second part deals with the less apparent problem
of providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled 
events are accessed to be executed.  Additional features
and problems dealt with include the proper handling 
of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created,
scheduled, and executed at the same points 
in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation
of such "zero-time" events are possible 
and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event
counts is practical and economical; and that a 
capability for handling  "time-displaceable" events is desirable and possible.
