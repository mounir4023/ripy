Abstract Data Types and Software Validation
A data abstraction can be naturally specified
using algebraic axioms.  The virtue of these 
axioms is that they permit a representation-independent
formal specification of a data type.  An example 
is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at
successive levels of implementation.  The  major 
thrust of the paper is twofold.  First, it is shown how
the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an abstract data type.  Second, semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms.  This implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design 
time, before a conventional implementation is accomplished.
