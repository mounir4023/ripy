A Graph Formulation of a School Scheduling Algorithm
The problem classically titled "The Examination
Schedule Problem" takes various forms in the 
literature.  Most of these formulations can be presented
in the terminology of classical Network Theory. 
 One such formulation is:  Given a nondirected network,
partition its nodes into a minimal number of 
subsets such that no two members of the same subset
are connected by anarc.  An obvious lower limit 
to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected
subgraph.  Kirchgassner proved that an upper 
limit is this size plus one.  One logical extension of
the previous work is the introduction of variable 
length examinations where W(I) is the number of periods
for exam I.  The object of this paper is to generalize 
the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph
to include the weighting of nodes, to present an 
approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest
strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the 
application of this algorithm to the solution of
school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.
