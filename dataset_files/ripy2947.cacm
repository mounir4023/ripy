SITAR: An Interactive Text Processing System for Small Computers
SITAR, a low-cost in teractive text handling
and text analysis system for nontechnical users, 
is in many ways comparable to in teractive bibliographical
search and retrieval systems, but has several 
additional features. It is implemented on a PDP/11 time-sharing
computer invoked by a CRT with microprogrammed 
editing functions.  It uses a simple command language designating
a function, a file, and a search template 
consisting of the textual string desired and strings
delimiting the context in which the hit is to be 
delivered.  Extensive experience with SITAR shows that
the combined powers of simple commands, string 
orientation, circular file structure, a CRT with local
memory, and conversational computing produce a 
system much more powerful than the sum of its parts.
