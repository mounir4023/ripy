A Precise Numerical Analysis Program
A description is given of a program for computing
the solution to a small number of standard 
numerical analysis problems to any specified accuracy,
up to a limit of 2000 correct decimal places. 
 Each computed number is bounded in an interval with a
multiple precision midpoint.  Arithmetic operations 
involving these numbers are executed according to interval
arithmetic concepts, with non-significant 
digits automatically discarded.  Details are supplied
of problem specification and problem computation.
