A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files
A simple algorithm is described for isolating
the differences between two files.  One application 
is the comparing of two versions of a source program
or other file in order to display all differences. 
 The algorithm isolates differences in a way that corresponds
closely to our intuitive notion of difference, 
is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient,
with time linear in the file length.  For most 
applications the algorithm isolates differences similar
to those isolated by the longest common subsequence. 
 Another application of this algorithm merges files
containing independently generated changes into a 
single file.  The algorithm can also be used to generate
efficient encodings of a file in the form of 
the differences between itself and a given "datum" file,
permitting reconstruction of the original file 
from the difference and datum files.
