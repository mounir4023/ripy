On Implementation of Label Variables
Variables of label mode are conventionally
implemented with a technique which fails to trap 
certain programming errors.  Fine-grained calendar clocks
have recently become available; these allow 
implementation of label variables via a new technique
which traps all programming errors of this variety.
