A General-Purpose Display Processing and Tutorial System
ADEPT (A display-Expedited Processing and Tutorial)
system is described.  This system was designed 
to improve man-computer communications by employing
a display unit to interleave tutoring with other 
computer operations such as simulation, programming, and
information retrieval.  It is written in FORTRAN 
IV (G) for the IBM System/360, Model 40, and the IBM 2250
display Unit under Operating System/360.  Adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  It expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  Language processors
and compilers, simulation models, mathematical 
solution techniques, stored data, and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming.  Illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications 
are discussed.
