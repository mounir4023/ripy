Animator: An On-Line Two-dimensional Film Animation System
Animator is a computer animation system which
was designed to overcome some of the inherent 
disadvantages associated with conventional computer animation
techniques.The DEC-338 serves as an input 
terminal for movie making, allowing the trial and error
design of picture sequences in a conversational 
mode.  During all stages on the system input elements
(light pen, pushbuttons, and teletype) is maintained. 
 At the user's request, this record is sent to the IBM
360/75 where the S-D 4020 instructions necessary 
to produce the same sequence of pictures can be generated.
 It is anticipated that one of the primary 
contributions of Animator will be the provision of a
facility which will allow any professor to produce 
his own expository film strips.
