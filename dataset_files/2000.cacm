A Variation of the Goodman-Lance Method for
the Solution of Two-Point Boundary Value Problems
A recently published method for the interpolative
solution of nonlinear equations is improved,
and applied to give a significant variation of the Goodman-Lance
method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems. 
The resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution
of optimal control problems in the Euler-Lagrange formulation.
Quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation
is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.
