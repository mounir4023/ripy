An Anomaly in Space-Time Characteristics of
Certain Programs Running in a Paging Machine
The running time of programs in a paging machine
generally increases as the store in which 
programs are constrained to run decreases.  Experiments,
however, have revealed cases in which the reverse 
is true: a decrease in the size of the store is accompanied
by a decrease in running time.  An informal 
discussion of the anomalous behavior is given, and for
the case of the FIFO replacement algorithm a formal 
treatment is presented.
