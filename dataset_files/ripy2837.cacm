New Upper Bounds for Selection
The worst-case minimum number of comparisons
complexity Vi(n) of the i-th selection problem 
is considered.  A new upper bound for Vi(n) improves the
bound given by the standard Hadian-Sobel algorithm 
by a generalization of the Kirkpatrick-Hadian-Sobel
algorithm, and extends Kirkpatrick's method to a 
much wider range of application.  This generalization
compares favorably with a recent algorithm by Hyafil.
