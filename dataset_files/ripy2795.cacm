Sentence Paraphrasing from a Conceptual Base
A model of natural language based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  A program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  This
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 In generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the information retrieval and
deduction capabilities of the memory model.  The 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;
(2) information relating conceptual to syntactic 
roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface
grammatical knowledge, stored in a formal grammar.
