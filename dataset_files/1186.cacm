Recursive Solution of a Class Of Combinatorial Problems: An Example
Combinatorial problems requiring the selection
of n elements from a set of m elements may be 
solved by a recursion process analogous to that for
computing binomial coefficients.  Several specific 
problems are analyzed, the general technique is exposed,
and an ALGOL program is developed for one of 
the problems.
