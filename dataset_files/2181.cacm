The State of Computer Oriented Curricula in Business Schools 1970
The ACM Committee on Computer Education for Management,
supported by a National Science Foundation 
Grant, is established to appraise the state of the art
and to develop a series of recommendations for 
improving computer education for management.  To provide
the Committee with material for its study of 
curricular needs, five regional meetings in the United
States were held in 1970, at each of which a broad 
cross section of invited academicians and practitioners
considered the state of curricula in business 
schools.  Three topics were covered: curricula for
the general manager; computer-related material in 
required and functional courses; and curricula for students
concentrating on computer-based information 
systems.  An analysis of the minutes of the meetings
revealed a common set of experiences which raised 
similar pedagogic and economic issues.  This presentation
gives a summary of the discussions; a condensation
of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised; and
consideration of the resource allocation issues 
involved.  Preliminary to the Committee's recommendations
for improving computer education for management, 
this report has been prepared to provide the participants
and the administrators of their institutions 
with background information for the ongoing task of course
development.  Chairman of the ten-man Committee 
is Daniel Teichroew (The University of Michigan).
