Conversion, Reconversion and Comparison
Techniques In Variable-Length Sorting
The logic is described for converting highly
variable input records into a format that can 
be easily and efficiently processed by a sorting program.
 The internal record formats are discussed 
in relation to (1) their conversion from input formats,
(2) their reconversion to output formats, and 
(3) comparison techniques between internal formats.
