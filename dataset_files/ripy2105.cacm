An Interactive Computer System Using Graphical Flowchart Input
An interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is 
described.  This system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by 
computer interpretation of a flowchart.  The user draws a description of a
sampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a large
scale computer.  The design is simulated, and a graphic representation of the 
processed signal is returned to the scope.  A successful design may require 
numerous modifications of the original design.  A graphical interactive system 
provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and 
effectively.
