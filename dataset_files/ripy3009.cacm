Insertions and Deletions In One-Sided Height-Balanced Trees
Recently Hirschberg has established that insertions
into one-sided height-balanced trees can 
be done in 0(log^2N) steps.  It is proved here that deletions
can also be performed in 0(log^2N) steps, 
which answers the open problem posed by Hirschberg.
