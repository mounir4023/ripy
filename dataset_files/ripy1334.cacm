Mechanization of Tedious Algebra: The
Newcomb Operators of Planetary Theory
A computer program has been written to generate
tables of formulas for the Newcomb operators 
of planetary theory.  The Newcomb operators are expressed
as polynomials in two variables, one of which 
stands for a simple differential operator, and the other
for an arbitrary integer.  The polynomials are 
generated by a recurrence scheme.  The program is coded in
FORTRAN, using simple array manipulation techniques 
to perform the algebraic operations.  Formulas for over
100 Newcomb operators have been produced by the 
program and typeset photographically on an S-560 Photon system.
