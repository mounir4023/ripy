The Use of an Interactive Information Storage
and Retrieval System in Medical Research
This paper presents the results of a study
of the use of an interactive computerized storage 
and retrieval system.  A monitor built into the computer
system provided usage data for the study.  Additional 
data on user reactions were gathe red from a questionnaire.
 The results show the important role played 
by frequently chosen laboratory reference leaders in influencing
the use of this system.  The implications 
of the study for the design of similar systems are discussed.
