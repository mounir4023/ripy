Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings
A common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded
set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences.
The basic approach is to find a termination function  that maps
the values of the program variables into some well-founded set,
such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced
throughout the computation.  All too often, the termination functions required 
are difficult to find and are of a complexity out
of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags)
over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences
of elements taken from S.  The given ordering on S induces
an ordering on the finite multisets over S.  This multiset ordering
is shown to be well-founded.  The multiset ordering enables the
use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise
difficult termination proofs.  In particular, the multiset
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems,
programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules.
