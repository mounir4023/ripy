Decomposition Programming An Analysis of Matrix Substructure 
A petroleum blending problem was analyzed in order
to compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition 
algorithms.  In the course of the analysis, a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two algorithms and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-Simplex solution without decomposition.
