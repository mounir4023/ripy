Object code Optimization
Methods of analyzing the control flow and data
flow of programs during compilation are applied 
to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency.
 Dominance relationships, indicating which 
statements are necessarily executed before others, are
used to do global common expression elimination 
and loop identification.  Implementation of these and other
optimizations in OS/360 FORTRAN H are described.
