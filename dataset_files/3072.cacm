Feedback Coupled Resource Allocation Policies
in the Multiprogramming- Multiprocessor Computer 
System
Model studies of some integrated, feedback-driven
scheduling systems for multiprogrammed- multiprocessor 
computer systems are presented.  The basic control variables
used are the data-flow rates for the processes 
executing on the CPU.  The model systems feature simulated
continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling 
of input-output activity.  Attention is given to the
amount of memory resource required for effective 
processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment).
 The model studies used both distribution-driven 
and trace-driven techniques.  Even relatively simple dynamic
schedulers are shown to improve system performance 
(as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal
or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded 
in identical system structures and workload environments.
 The improvement is greatest under a heavy 
I/O demand workload.
