A Note on the Calculation Working Set Size
Finite-length reference string of arbitrary
structure are considered, and an exact expression 
for average working set size in terms of "corrected"
interreference interval statistics is derived.  
An example is discussed; upper and lower bounds are obtained;
and the average working set size function 
is shown to be efficiently obtained for a set of page
sizes, in a single pass of the reference string. 
 This work follows the developments of a paper by Denning
and Schwartz, who consider infinite-length 
reference strings which satisfy certain statistical
properties and who derive an expression relating 
the asymptotic average working set size to the asymptotic
missing page rate function under working set 
replacement.
