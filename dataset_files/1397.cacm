Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation
The ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic
Manipulation brought together over four hundred 
people interested in programming languages designed
for manipulation of algebraic formulas and symbol 
strings, in their applications, and in algorithms for
their implementation.  Twenty-eight papers were 
presented, followed by a lively panel discussion of
future directions.  Evening meetings were arranged 
for several interest groups.  The conference was sponsored
by the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic 
and Algebraic Manipulation.  The program committee consisted
of Chairman Jean E. Sammet, Paul Abrahams, 
Thomas E. Cheatham, Max Goldstein, and Douglas Mcllroy.
 Conference arrangements were made by Lewis C. 
Clapp, Daniel Bobrow and James H. Griesmer.-Robert W. Floyd, Editor
