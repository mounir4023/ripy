Estimates of Distributions of Random Variables
for Certain Computer Communications Traffic Models
A study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  The model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  Data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
It is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.  Approximations to the gamma distribution
by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.
