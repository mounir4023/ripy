Packed Scatter Tables
Scatter tables for open addressing benefit
from recursive entry displacements, cutoffs for 
unsuccessful searches, and auxiliary cost functions.  Compared
with conventional methods, the new techniques 
provide substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solution
optimal packings.  The displacements 
are depth-limited approximations to an enumerative
(exhaustive) optimization, although packing costs 
remain linear-O(n)-with table size n.  The techniques are
primarily suited for important fixed (but possibly 
quite large) tables for which reference frequencies may
be known: op-code tables,spelling dictionaries, 
access arrays.  Introduction of frequency weights further
improves retrievals, but the enhancement may 
degrade cutoffs.
