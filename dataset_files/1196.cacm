Applications of Differential Equations in General Problem Solving
A large class of problems leading to digital
computer processing can be formulated in terms 
of the numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential
equations.  Powerful methods are in existence 
for the solution of such systems.  A good general purpose
routine for the solution of such systems furnishes 
a powerful tool for processing many problems.  This is
true from the point of view of ease of programming, 
ease of debugging, and minimization of computer time.
 A number of examples are discussed in detail.
