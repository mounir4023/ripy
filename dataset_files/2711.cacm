A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing
In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  An approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.
