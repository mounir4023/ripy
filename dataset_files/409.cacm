CL-1, An Environment for a Compiler
A flexible, large-scale programming system to
facilitate the solution of information processing 
problems and to provide intercommunication between programs
and/or programmers has been developed and 
realized on the IBM 709/7090 computer.  The system is
based on a master file concept and has provisions 
for accepting, storing, and retrieving both descriptions
and instances of large and complex data sets, 
as well as algorithms defined on these data sets.  Both
data and algorithms may be expressed in a family 
of command and descriptive languages.  The concept
of distinct data descriptions and the content and 
use of such descriptions are discussed in some detail.
