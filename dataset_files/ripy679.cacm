Recent Improvements in MADCAP
MADCAP is a programming language admitting subscripts,
superscripts and certain forms of displayed 
formulas.  The basic implementation of this language was
described in a previous paper [MADCAP: A scientific 
compiler for a displayed formula textbook language, Comm.
ACM 4 (Jan. 61), 31-36].  This paper discusses 
recent improvements in the language in three areas: complex
display, logical control, and subprogramming. 
 In the area of complex display, the most prominent improvements
are a notation for integration and for 
the binomial coefficients.  In the area of logical control
the chief new feature is a notation for variably 
nested looping.  The discussion of subprogramming is focused
on MADCAP's notation for and use of "procedures."
