Anomalies with Variable Partition Paging Algorithms
Five types of anomalous behavior which may
occur in paged virtual memory operating systems 
a redefined.  One type of anomaly, for example, concerns
the fact that, with certain reference strings 
and paging algorithms, an increase in mean memory allocation
may result in an increase in fault rate. 
 Two paging algorithms, are examined in terms of their
anomaly potential, and reference string examples 
of various anomalies are presented.  Two paging algorithm
properties, the inclusion property and the 
generalized inclusion property, are discussed and the
anomaly implications of these properties presented.
